## About

This application is handy for any user wanting to keep or discard notes so the user may organize their thoughts, plans or ideas throughout the day. The source code was provided from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka and as a developer I needed to implement changes in order to use Express.js to save the user input and display them on the lefthand side of the screen.
